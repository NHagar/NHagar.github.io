    "I research how collective attention works in large, complex systems. I use data science and engineering to study how people discover information online, why things get popular, and what influences content creators. My first love is journalism, but I also study large social platforms such as TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook along with other attention markets like Netflix and Substack.",

I've written for Pacific Standard, the Christian Science Monitor, McSweeney's Internet Tendency, and others.
