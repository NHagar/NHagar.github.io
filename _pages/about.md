I research collective attention problems on digital platforms, with a focus on news media. I'm concerned with attention inequality and its impact on digital marketplaces, models of collective information retrieval, and algorithms' role in shaping attention.

Current projects include simulating collective attention to popular items on Netflix, modeling cumulative advantage in linking behavior on Substack, and building a framework for more robust sampling of news archives, among others. My work uses computational methods, such as simulation, network analysis, and natural language processing.

Before grad school, I worked in audience development and analytics at Fusion Media Group, Digiday, Pacific Standard and the Dallas Morning News. I’ve written for Pacific Standard, the Christian Science Monitor, McSweeney’s Internet Tendency and others. I graduated from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in 2017 and am originally from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
