The Times [recently announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/business/media/nyt-newsletters.html) a slew of newsletters limited to paid subscribers. They're converting existing newsletters to paid and creating new offerings explicitly for this push.

This effort drives home the heart of newsletters' success—they're a pure distillation of writing into a digital product. Micropayments are too clunky. Wide-ranging subscriptions rely on heavy usage, while most news consumers are casual browsers. Newsletters circumvent these issues with a few key qualities:

## Proactive delivery

All attention markets are saturated, on both ends. Open publishing channels flood platforms with more content than anyone could ever consume. Cheap and easy access to this content leaves people with almost no extra time. There's no room to expand.

In such a tight market, access is key. Nothing beats directly reaching an audience, without needing them to come find you. Games and streaming services work hard for dedicated real estate on your devices, or in your home. News tries to adapt this strategy (push notifications), but these efforts are limited. Publishers still largely rely on you clicking a link and going to a webpage.

Newsletters give outlets a footing with their audience. They combine notification, dedicated real estate, and a discrete piece of content. No longer do organizations need to bank on audiences devoting a substantial chunk of time to their website; they can just live in your inbox.

## Focused branding

The most successful newsletters have a tight focus. Rather than translating an entire news outlet into email, they tackle a particular niche: the business of video games, recipes, a sports team. Would-be subscribers get a clear value proposition, and existing audiences get a set of reliable expectations.

This is important for paying subscribers—people want to know exactly what they're paying for. From an organization's perspective, it can also break out subscription revenue in a beneficial way. A reader might not want to pay for an *entire* site subscription, but they may care enough about, say, tech to pay for a dedicated newsletter. This allows for more fine-grained pricing, and a potentially larger base of paying readers on the whole.

## Set schedule

Hand in hand with setting expectations around branding, newsletters promise an exact quantity of content to subscribers. Readers know to expect a post, of roughly similar length and format, every day/week/month.

Contrast this with casual news readership. Maybe you browse a news site every morning, but there's no guarantee that *what you want to read* will consistently show up.  Breaking news is a big draw, but it doesn't follow a predictable cadence.

Audiences respond to predictability. Knowing exactly when and where to focus your attention lets you plan, lets you integrate a piece of content into your routine. A finite piece of writing delivered regularly fits into that mental model much easier than a never-ending stream of news stories, many of which will not be directly relevant to the reader's interests.

These qualities are good for the popularity of email newsletters. Are they good for digital writing on the whole? Early results paint a conflicted picture. Independent writers have more tools at their disposal for making a living online than ever before, but that independence also accelerates a trend away from stable jobs (with benefits) at organizations. Direct relationships with audiences allow creative control and hyper-focus on niches, but newsletters are subject to the same oversaturation and attention inequality issues of all other platforms.

The big change, then, comes from the shift to a direct payment model. Subscriptions simply *would not work* without the qualities listed here. Writers have to orient their output around that digital product mindset, which may be an uncomfortable proposition for some. The creator economy writ large is premised on direct payments from audiences, but this is not a one-size-fits-all model. We've seen the adverse effects of advertising models on the style and content of online writing. It's naïve to assume subscription models won't have negative byproducts of their own.
