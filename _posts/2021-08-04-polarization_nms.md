description: Demonstrating the integrated nature of political polarization in digital news media
---
Recently, a paper I worked on with Johannes Wachs and Emőke-Ágnes Horvát was published in *New Media & Society.* We looked at political polarization in news production, by tracking how freelancers and other writers move from outlet to outlet over time. This paper complements work done on polarized news consumption, showing how integrated political leaning is throughout the digital media sphere. Key findings are summarized below, and you can read the whole paper [here](https://johanneswachs.com/papers/hhw_nms21.pdf).

## 1. Writers move along political lines

Overwhelmingly, news contributors of all kinds stick to one side of the aisle when moving between outlets. There are very few cases of crossover, meaning political leaning largely governs which outlets writers contribute to. One big difference between the left and right leaning clusters is structure - connections between right leaning outlets are extremely dense. This means movement among all right leaning outlets is extremely common, while some paths through the left leaning cluster are weak or nonexistent.

## 2. Topics vary by political leaning

These movement patterns also impact the kinds of news that audiences see. Writers in these clusters focus on distinct topics - the left leaning cluster focuses more on the media and the press, for example, while the right leaning cluster places a greater emphasis on Republican politics. These differences are important not because of any value judgment on the topics, but because they highlight how news producer behaviors propagate all the way down to news consumers.

## 3. Cross-cutting writers steer clear of political topics

There is a prevalent viewpoint that reading more broadly, ["bursting" your filter bubble](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/problem-social-media-reinforcement-bubbles-what-you-can-do-about-ncna1063896), helps reduce polarization by exposing you to opposing viewpoints. We looked for evidence of this behavior in news production, hoping to find cases of writers sharing their perspective across the aisle. And while we did find a portion of news writers who moved between clusters, they did not broach difficult topics. Instead, they focused on areas that many would consider less explicitly political - sports, family, and finance, for example. Perhaps to maintain their broad appeal, cross-cutting writers limited themselves to topics that weren't overrepresented in either cluster.

To summarize, our work demonstrates how *integrated* political polarization is in digital media. Interventions aimed just at news audiences, or at social media platforms, won't solve the issue of polarization on their own, because it's present at every stage of news production, distribution, and consumption. We need to think structurally, about how to build a healthier public sphere centered on quality information.
