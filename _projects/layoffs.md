**Abstract:** Layoffs are responsible for the loss of thousands of journalists' jobs in recent years, making resource constraints a key factor in digital news production. Despite the prevalence of newsroom layoffs, how they affect the coverage that an outlet publishes is unclear. In this study, I examine the January 2019 layoffs at BuzzFeed News. Using the full set of stories published 6 weeks before and after these layoffs, I first demonstrate a drop in the amount of news coverage produced per day by the site. By analyzing the text of each news story, I then show that the semantic diversity of the site's coverage also declines. These results suggest a thinning out of coverage in response to layoffs, one that affects some parts of the site far more than others.

**Methods:** Semantic embeddings, clustering, regression discontinuity design
