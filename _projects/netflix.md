**Abstract:** This project examines the dynamics of collective attention on Netflix. We propose to analyze the relative popularity of the top 10 movies and TV shows on the platform over time, guided by three research questions. First, what is the typical popularity trajectory for an item on Netflix? Second, how often do new releases enter the top 10, and for how long do they remain? Finally, how do new entries impact the popularity distribution of all other items? We plan to answer these questions with three months of top 10 data from Netflix. Following approaches laid out in prior work on collective attention, we plan to model the Netflix attention cycle and examine how sudden bursts of attention interrupt its typical dynamics.

**Methods:** Computational simulation
