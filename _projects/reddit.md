**Abstract:** Many attention markets exhibit stable patterns of concentration, where a few producers attract and sustain a far greater share of the audience than all others. This inequality often follows patterns consistent with cumulative advantage, a process in which performance compounds over time. However, online audiences also fragment across many disparate producers. How do social media and recommender systems figure in these patterns? In this study, we examine two paradigmatic models: concentration driven by cumulative advantage and fragmentation driven by stochasticity. We evaluate these models against a large scale empirical dataset of news source attention in the popular social media site Reddit. While we find high levels of attention concentration, we do not find the popularity stability over time that characterizes cumulative advantage. Rather, sources gain and lose popularity seemingly at random, aligning with a stochastic model of attention. These results demonstrate the persistence of attention inequality, even in the absence of a strong driving mechanism. As a consequence, digital attention markets striving for equitable allocation require novel mechanisms of organizing and distributing information.

**Methods:** Web scraping, computational simulation
