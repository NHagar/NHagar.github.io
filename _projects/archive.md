**Abstract:** As digital distribution becomes the dominant modality of news media, it brings a number of benefits for communications researchers. Amassing large quantities of structured, searchable news text data becomes far more feasible, as evidenced by the handful of ongoing research projects designed for this purpose (e.g., GDELT and Media Cloud). At the same time, gathering news data straight from their sources present challenges. Ingesting text data from a wide variety of news sources involves navigating potential parsing issues. Choosing a sample of sites from which to collect data involves difficult trade offs, between scoping feasibility and the risk of missing important material. Third party databases are difficult to assess for completeness, introducing the possibility of biased samples. To combat these issues, we propose a method of cross-database comparison, data collection, and reporting for large-scale samples of news articles. 

**Methods:** Web scraping, topic modeling
