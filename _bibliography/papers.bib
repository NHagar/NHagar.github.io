    abstract = "{Many attention markets exhibit stable patterns of concentration, where a few producers attract and sustain a far greater share of the audience than others. This inequality often follows patterns consistent with cumulative advantage, a process in which performance compounds over time. Attention to news sources online possesses these characteristics; however, online audiences also fragment across many disparate news producers. How do social media and recommender systems contribute to these attention dynamics? In this study, we examine two paradigmatic models: concentration driven by cumulative advantage and fragmentation driven by stochasticity. We evaluate these models against a large-scale empirical dataset of news source attention in the popular social media site Reddit. While we find high levels of attention concentration, we do not find the stable popularity over time that characterizes cumulative advantage. Rather, sources gain and lose popularity seemingly at random, aligning with a stochastic model. These results demonstrate the persistence of attention inequality, even in the absence of a strong driving mechanism. They also suggest that social media systems can undermine the accumulation of attention to the most prominent news sources. Digital attention markets striving for more equitable allocation require novel mechanisms of organizing and distributing information.}",

  abstract = {Headlines play an important role in both news audiences' attention decisions online and in news organizations' efforts to attract that attention. A large body of research focuses on developing generally applicable heuristics for more effective headline writing. In this work, we measure the importance of a number of theoretically motivated textual features to headline performance. Using a corpus of hundreds of thousands of headline A/B tests run by hundreds of news publishers, we develop and evaluate a machine-learned model to predict headline testing outcomes. We find that the model exhibits modest performance above baseline and further estimate an empirical upper bound for such contentbased prediction in this domain, indicating an important role for non-content-based factors in test outcomes. Together, these results suggest that any particular headline writing approach has only a marginal impact, and that understanding reader behavior and headline context are key to predicting news attention decisions.},

  abstract = {Audience analytics are an increasingly essential part of the modern newsroom as publishers seek to maximize the reach and commercial potential of their content. On top of a wealth of audience data collected, algorithmic approaches can then be applied with an eye towards predicting and optimizing the performance of content based on historical patterns. This work focuses specifically on content optimization practices surrounding the use of A/B headline testing in newsrooms. Using such approaches, digital newsrooms might audience-test as many as a dozen headlines per article, collecting data that allows an optimization algorithm to converge on the headline that is best with respect to some metric, such as the click-through rate. This article presents the results of an interview study which illuminate the ways in which A/B testing algorithms are changing workflow and headline writing practices, as well as the social dynamics shaping this process and its implementation within US newsrooms.},

  abstract = {Digital news outlets rely on a variety of outside contributors, from freelance journalists, to political commentators, to executives and politicians. These external dependencies create a network among news outlets, traced along the contributors they share. Using connections between outlets, we demonstrate how contributors' publishing trajectories tend to align with outlet political leanings. We also show how polarized clustering of outlets translates to differences in the topics of news covered and the style and tone of articles published. In addition, we demonstrate how contributors who cross partisan divides tend to focus on less explicitly political topics. This work addresses an important gap in the media polarization literature, by highlighting how structural factors on the production side of news media create an ecosystem shaped by political leanings, independent of the priorities of any one person or organization.},
